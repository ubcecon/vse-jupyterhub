# vse-jupyterhub

This repository contains the Dockerfile for the [Syzygy JupyterHub service](https://vse.syzygy.ca) at the Vancouver School of Economics. 

**Note** that this isn't sufficient to replicate the service at your home institution. There are some constraints on the Docker host that need to be satisfied. We are working on producing those instructions. 

For any questions, troubleshooting, etc., email `me@arnavsood.com`.
